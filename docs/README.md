# Common Lisp Documentation

### What is this ?
This is a copy of the [Common Lisp HyperSec](http://clhs.lisp.se), but with a cleaner interface. It supports full-text search, syntax highlighting for examples and some other cool stuff.

### Differences with CLHS
Informations displayed on this website is an exact copy of the original documentation. However, it doesn't include issues and some symbols like variables, condition types...

### Behind the scenes
This website is made using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org) and a custom parser for the CLHS documentation.
